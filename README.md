# Simon Game

## Description
The *Simon Game* is a classic memory game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of lights and sounds.
Each level adds a new color to the pattern, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly to move on.

This project is built using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript*, and is a fun way to practice DOM manipulation and game logic.

## How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the color sequence shown.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the same colors in order.
4. Each new level adds one more color to the sequence.
5. Make a mistake, and the game ends â€” press any key to restart.
